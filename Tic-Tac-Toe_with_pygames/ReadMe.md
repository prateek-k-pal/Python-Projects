# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe created with Python. The game is built using the Pygame library. You can view the source code in the [`source.py`](./source.py) file. If you'd like to play the game without running the code yourself, you can download and run the executable from the [`source.exe`](./dist/source.exe) file located in the 'dist' directory.

### Enjoy the Game!!!
